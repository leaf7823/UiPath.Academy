### Q) What type of input is an input originating from two invoices that contain the same kind of information, but have different layouts? Choose one of the options below
- [-] Standard
- [o] Non-Standard

---
### Q) The objective of Opportunity Assessment is to…  Choose all the options that apply 
- [-] Determine what is in-scope and out-of-scope for the automation
- [o] Determine the automation suitablility of each individual process
- [o] Calculate the potential automation benefits of each of the processes taken into consideration
- [o] Priortize processes depending on their complexity

```
The BA determines what is in-scope and out-of-scope for the automation during the Solution Design phase, 
once a process has been chosen for automation.
```

### Q) An interface change that has an impact on the execution workflow is considered to be a... Choose one of the options below
- [-] Standard change
- [o] Emergency change
- [-] Normal change
- [-] None of the listed options

```
The provided example is considered to be an emergency change as it can be a show stopper 
for Go-Live or it can endanger the production environment. 
It needs priority treatment due to time pressure and has a different approval 
and implementation process compared to other changes.
```

### Q) What are the responsibilities of a BA during the Testing phase of an RPA implementation?Choose all the options that apply
- [-] Fix bugs
- [o] Collect the positive and negative results
- [o] Ensure that all the test cases are executed
- [o] Provide testing result statuses

---
### Q) If part of a process is left out of scope for RPA, what could be the impact on the To-Be process mapping? Choose all the options that apply
- [o] The robot might need to wait for the human to complete that part of the process before proceeding further
- [o] The robot might need to be restarted
- [-] There is no impact
- [o] The order of the steps might change

### Q) The best way of capturing complex business rules is by using a Business Logic Translation Table
- [o] False
- [-] True

```
A Business Logic Translation Table is an optional piece of documentation which does not apply to all processes. 
It typically contains mappings between certain situations and the actions that need to be taken. 
The best way of capturing complex business rules is by creating video recordings of all the process activities individually, 
and adding the appropriate explanatory voiceovers.
```

---
### Q) Match each phase of the RPA Journey with the BA's corresponding responsibilities
- [o] Prepare RPA : creating an inventory of the existing processes and conducting the opportunity assessment
- [o] Solution Design : Creating the Process Design Document, test cases and test scenarios
- [?] Constant improvement : 
- [?] Build RPA : 
- [?] Test RPA : 
- [?] Stabillize RPA : 

---
### Q) What are some of the factors that determine the complexity of an automation process?
- [o] Type of applications
- [-] FTE Savings
- [o] Variations/Scenarios
- [o] Type of input
- [o] Number of screens

```
The FTE savings percentage is a factor which determines the potential benefits of an automation.
```

---
### Q) The relationship between a test scenario and a test case is always one to one (1:1)
- [-] True
- [o] False

```
The relationship between a test scenario and a test case may be either one to one or one to many, 
which, in the latter case, means a test scenario can have one or more test cases.
```

---
### Q) Match each type of change with its corresponding approval requirements
- [o] Normal Change : needs formal assessment
- [o] Emergency Change : needs priority treatment due to time pressure and has a different approval process
- [o] Standard Changes : no approval is required and can be performed by the RPA Developer

---
### Q) During Testing, the test cases have to be executed manually by a human user to ensure that the resulting output matches the one returned by the robot.
- [o] True
- [-] False
